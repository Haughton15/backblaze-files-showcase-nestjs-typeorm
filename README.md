## Project Description:
This project aims to demonstrate how to implement file uploads to the Backblaze cloud storage platform using NestJS with TypeORM, AWS SDK (for Backblaze compatibility), and Multer. Backblaze is a cost-effective and reliable cloud storage service, and this example will provide a guide on how to handle file uploads to this platform securely and efficiently, while also showcasing how to connect with AWS services through its SDK.

Technologies Used:

NestJS: A popular Node.js framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.
TypeORM: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for TypeScript and JavaScript that simplifies database interactions.
AWS SDK: The AWS SDK for JavaScript, which we'll use not only to interact with Backblaze's S3-compatible API but also to demonstrate its versatility in connecting with other AWS services.
Multer: A middleware for handling file uploads in Node.js applications.
Project Components:
(Previously listed components remain the same.)

This project will serve as a comprehensive guide for developers looking to integrate file uploads with Backblaze into their NestJS applications, showcasing best practices for security, reliability, and scalability. Additionally, it will illustrate how the AWS SDK can be utilized to connect to both Backblaze and other AWS services, making it a versatile and powerful solution for cloud-based file storage and management. By following this example, developers can ensure that their applications effectively and securely handle file uploads to Backblaze while leveraging the AWS SDK for broader cloud infrastructure needs.
